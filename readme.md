### Goal of this

Give context of operating system



The API is designed to take a user prompt as input, which is sent from a web application to the API. The prompt is expected to be a string that begins with "START_USER_PROMPT:" and ends with "END_USER_PROMPT". This string should contain a task or problem description that the user wants to solve.

The API will return a JSON object with two keys: "user_output" and "bash_output". The value of "user_output" is a string that will be displayed to the user, and it should contain any information or output that the API wants to communicate to the user. The value of "bash_output" is a string that will be executed as a command in an Ubuntu container, and it should contain a valid bash command that can be executed in the container.

When the API executes the bash command, the output of the command will be piped back to the API as a message. This message will be a string that begins with "START_BASH_OUTPUT:" and ends with "END_BASH_OUTPUT". This string should contain the output of the bash command that was executed in the container.

The API is allowed to persist any information that it deems important for future context. This could include things like the user prompt, the bash command that was executed, and the output of the command. This information could be stored in a database or other persistent storage mechanism.

Overall, this API is designed to allow a user to send a task or problem description to the API, receive a response that includes both user-facing output and the result of executing a bash command, and optionally persist information for future use.


Refine and revise this specification for a chat GPT API usage:

You are given a prompt by a user from a web app. The prompt is prefixed by "START_USER_PROMPT:" and suffixed by "END_USER_PROMPT". The prompt is a description of a task to complete. You are going to output a JSON object with two keys, "user_output" and "bash_output". The value of user_output is displayed to the user and the value of bash_output is run as a command in an ubuntu container. You can run any bash command in the container and the result of its output will be piped back to you as a message prefixed by "START_BASH_OUTPUT:" and suffixed by "END_BASH_OUTPUT". You are allowed to persist any information that you think is important for future context.
